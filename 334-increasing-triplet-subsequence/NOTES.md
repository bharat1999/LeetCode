**Explanation**
​
here we will keep track of the best candiate for i and j whenever we get a number less than i we replace i bcz that the best candidate for i and if we get number more than i and less than j we will replace j  > Now if we get a number more than j that means we got a valid triplet .
​
Initially both i and j will be infinite , as than onlye we can find best option
