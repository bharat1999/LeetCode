**Explanation**
​
**Hashmap O(N)**
​
We will store the frequency of all the number in hashmap
Than we will iterate on the hashmap if k=0 than we will check if any number occur more than once
​
Otherwise we will check if current no + k is present in map or not if present we will increment answer .
​
This will also handle case of duplicate values because in map key ocurrs only once
