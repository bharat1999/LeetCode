same as 2 sum but here we need to avoid duplicates also
​
for example -2,0,0,2,2 here
​
i=0 so target = 0-2 = -2
​
s =1 e=4
​
so we will get one answer at s=1 and e=4 that is 0 and 2
so we increase s by 1 and decrease e by 1
​
now at s=2 and e=3 we got same values so we need to avoid them so whenver we get a answer we will loop till getting same value
