**Explanation**
​
This is a graph problem as one variable can be part of multiple equations and solution can be found by the shortest weighted path
​
examp a,b = 2 b,c = 3
​
graph = a ->b ->c
weight       2      3
​
now we need to find a ,c so we start from a and find path till and multiply all values in between so answer will be 2 *3 which is correct
