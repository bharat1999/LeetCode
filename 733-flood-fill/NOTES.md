**Explanation**
â€‹
This is a DFS problem we will start from a destination and iterate on its neighbours than on their neighbours, we will keep track of visited so that we can avoid unneccesary call and we will color the nodes on coming back in recursion because if if colour than the condition to color same colors nodes will become false
