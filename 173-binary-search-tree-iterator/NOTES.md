Brute Force time O(n) Space O(n)
​
Do inorder traversal and store all nodes in array and do requried opertions in O(1) time
​
Stack Approach time O(n) Space O(h)
​
Use stack to do iterative inorder we will push all the left child of root and when next is called we pop top and push its right and all left
​
So atmost O(h) memoery will be used
