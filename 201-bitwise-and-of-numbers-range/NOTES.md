**Explanation**
​
This question is done on the concept of Most Significatn Bit  of any number as we know for AND , if any ith bit is 0 of any number in  than ith bit in anwer will be 0.
​
We also observe a pattern that for a series of number left to right we can see that the answer will be equal to the number numbe rmade from the bits those are same in left and right
​
For exampl 5 to 7
​
5 = 1 0 1
6 = 1 1 0
7 - 1 1 1
​
Here we see that only the leftmost bit is same for left and right and other are different that means their guarantees a number in b/w that will make other bits zero
​
So we will first calculate MSB of left and right if they are not equal than answer will be 0
​
otherwise the answer will be equal to the number generated by the same bits in left and right iterating from MSB to 0
