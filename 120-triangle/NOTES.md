**Explanation**
​
Here we will start from the top and look for all possible paths
For each row i , we have two choices goto i+1,j and i+1,j+1 , So we will take minimum of the values returned by both paths and add it to current cell value
​
But here we will have some overlapping problems
So we will optimise using DP
