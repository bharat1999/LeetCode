1 0 2 1 1 2
low =0 high = 4
​
now we will not increment i because the swapped value can be 0 and we have to take it back
​
now we have 1 at i =0 so we will do nothing
​
i = 1 we have 0 so we need to take it to low index
so we swap value at low with i
​
and increment both i and low because it is gauranteed that current value at either 0 or greater
​
so now array = 0 1 2 1 1 2
low = 1 i =2 high =4
​
now we have 2 so we swap it with high
array = 0 1 1 1 2 2
​
i = 2 low =1 and high =3
​
we get 1 so continue than
​
we get 2 but both i and high are same so swapping have no affect than high become less than i and stop
