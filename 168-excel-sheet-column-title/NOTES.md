**Explanation**
​
This is just the reverse of Excel Sheet Colun Number . In that the alphabet was acting as a digit and we are mutiplying with 26. Here we are given the number , and we need to construct the string , so we reverse the process , we extract a char by taking modulus of number by 26 and converting that to equivalent string and dividng number by 26
​
but here in each iterating we will decrement n by 1 bcz in question A =1 but in char system it is from 1 so we decrement our n by 1
