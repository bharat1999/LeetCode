**Explanation**
â€‹
Here the optimal solution is derived from a concept as peak valley approach where instead of waiting for more profit we will sell whenever we are getting a little profit, it can be visually proved that this technique will give the max profit in our senario
â€‹
So logic is
â€‹
iterate i =1 to n-1
â€‹
if p[i] > p[i-1]
ans+ = p[i] - p[i-1]
