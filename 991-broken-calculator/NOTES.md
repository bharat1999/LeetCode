**Explanation**
​
Instead of multiplying and subtracting we will go backwards and modify the target
. If target is even we divide and if its odd we add+1 . untill target become less than startvalue
This is a greedy approch bcz whenever possible divide will lead to less opeartions
​
ex start = 5 and target = 9
​
here target is odd so we add 1 to it operation = 1
target = 10 so divide by 2 operation = 2
now startvalue become >=target
so we got our answer
