**Explanation**
​
Here we have to first check if all rows do not have the same number
after that we have to do same for all columns that can we easily done through 2 loops
​
Now for checking if all 9 boxes od 3*3 are valid we need to make two loops can iterate over all these 9 boxes and inside those we have to check
​
So we will run two loop form 0 to 8 with increment of 3 in each iteration
​
than to get starting row and col of every box
​
we calculate as row = (i/3)*3 and col = (j/3)*3
